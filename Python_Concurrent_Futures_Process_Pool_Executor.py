# Python Concurrent Futures
# concurrent.futures � Launching parallel tasks.
# The concurrent.futures module provides a high-level interface for asynchronously executing callables.
# The asynchronous execution can be performed with threads, using ThreadPoolExecutor, or separate processes, using ProcessPoolExecutor.
# Both implement the same interface, which is defined by the abstract Executor class.
# ProcessPoolExecutor.
# The ProcessPoolExecutor class is an Executor subclass that uses a pool of processes to execute calls asynchronously.
# ProcessPoolExecutor uses the multiprocessing module, which allows it to side-step the Global Interpreter Lock but also means that only
# picklable objects can be executed and returned.
# The __main__ module must be importable by worker subprocesses. This means that ProcessPoolExecutor will not work in the interactive interpreter.
# Calling Executor or Future methods from a callable submitted to a ProcessPoolExecutor will result in deadlock.
